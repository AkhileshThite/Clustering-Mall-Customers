# Clustering: Mall customers
• The dataset contains some customer information of a mall along with their mall spending time (entries).

• I've successfully separated all the customers into groups by using **"K-means clusturing"** algorithm, So advertisers can target a specific group of customers to increase the profits of the mall.
